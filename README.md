#Boris Bikes 

This repo seeks to emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required for a new bike system for TFL

#Motivation

This is the first pair programming session 

#Skills demonstrated

TDD -> learning to write Rspec tests first and foremost. This represents the logic when thinking about how one imagines the classes/methods to interact, and is used to steer how we define classes/methods
The art of test writing -> learning to write tests neatly, descriptively and concisely
Practicing OOD -> using different objects (class instances) and setting up interactions between them
Encapsulation -> understanding why certain getters (attr_readers) should be private (i.e. the user cannot access or edit class instance variables directly, and must use the prescribed methods pertinent to the class in question) 
SRP -> designing methods to perform a single responsibility. This does not mean a method cannot invoke other methods from within, just that each method should only do one thing for clarity's sake
Modules -> Refactoring similar code into a module, that can then be imported back into the relevant classes. This displays an understanding of inheritance

#Comments

Modules are pretty cool
